Our next meeting is almost upon us! On Wednesday February 22nd at 6:30PM we will beÂ **making our own video games**.

The plan is for us toÂ try out mob programming/blind learning: we'll split into some groups (one laptop each) and try out a game development environment (e.g., <a href="https://www.scirra.com/construct2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Construct 2 (Free Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameMaker Studio Free</a>, or <a href="https://unity3d.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unity (Personal)</a>) from installation through to (hopefully) a working game! No prior knowledge required. ðŸ˜Ž
