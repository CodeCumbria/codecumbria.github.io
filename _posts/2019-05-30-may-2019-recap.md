Our second event of 2019 was once again hosted by our friends at [The Guild](https://www.theguild-carlisle.co.uk/) in Carlisle. As [advertised](/2019/05/may-2019-lean-coffee/) it was a [Lean Coffee](http://leancoffee.org/) session. Here are the topic titles we discussed, in order we voted for them:

- Home Automation: How? What?
- Is privacy a "luxury good"?[^1]
- [Platform-as-a-Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) vs. traditional servers
- Should exception handling be used for flow control?
- How to [gamify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification) football training?[^2]
- How to discourage a serial killer!![^3]
- Has technology made democracy impossible?
- Are there too many e-systems in [software] development?

It was a good mix of topics, which generated some good conversations.

## Next Event

Our next event will be held on Wednesday June 28th, again hosted by [The Guild](https://www.theguild-carlisle.co.uk/) at their amazing co-working space.

We have a few talks lined up:

- "A gentle introduction to [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/): A performant if suboptimal example" by [Andew Donaldson](https://twitter.com/adonaldson)
- "Introduction to [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)" by [David Murphy](https://twitter.com/schwuk)
- Project Showcase: a demonstration of projects our members have been working on. This will be kicked off by [Matthew Proudman](https://twitter.com/Matthewproudman), but other attendees are welcome to show off their work too

See you in June!
