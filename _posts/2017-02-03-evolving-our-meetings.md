At our last meeting Andrew led a discussion on the future of Code Cumbria; what was originally intended to be a call to action to get more stewards soon turned into a round table discussion on what people want Code Cumbria to **be**. Here are his (edited) notes.

### What is Code Cumbria?

  * Community
  * To learn stuff
  * To be visible
  * Grow a scene
  * Social 
      * It was noticed that of all the people that could attend, those that do are predominantly the remote workers and the young (highlighting the importance of social for the group)

### Talks vs. topics<figure id="attachment_32" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32" style="width: 225px" class="caption alignright">

  <figcaption>Ideas for developing Code Cumbria</figcaption>
</figure> 

  * We should focus on topics, not talks
  * Creating talks is proving too difficult
  * Rather than "dredging up" talks each month (which is frustrating for the <del>organisers</del> stewards, and daunting for the members), we should instead focus on topics – be it a 30s intro or a 15min presentation, then the remainder of the meeting will be based around that topic (or topics)
  * In order to set expectations topics will be proposed, discussed and voted on at the end of the (current) meeting
  * This will set a general theme for the next meeting which helps with marketing
  * Essentially our lean coffee style structured discussions distilled and evolved

### General ideas

  * Don't be so anxious about deep dives into tech; we shouldn't favour the safe/broad topics
  * Consider the group watching of tech videos for discussion after; like a book club but without the requirement of reading a full book!
  * Consider live or recorded presentations from remote speakers with potential for live Q&As after: 
      * Technically possible?
      * Worthwhile?
  * Side project show and tell
  * Open ourselves up to more content: 
      * Local tech demos for PR
      * vacancies/recruiting
  * Group activities e.g.,explore new topic: 
      * [Mob programming](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/01/using-mob-programming-to-solve-a-problem/) – more social than everyone on their own device
      * "Blind" learning – no previous knowledge required; we all learn together
  * Fact blast™ – choose a topic, split to research individually or groups, then review as a group to share what we have learnt
  * Consider food/refreshments &#8211; sweets, ice cream, pizza, Nandos 
      * **NB: **We are (currently) unfunded so it is not clear how this will work
