Our January meeting was a great start to the year, with a good turnout and at least one new face. ðŸ™‚

Following our traditional round-the-room introductions, [Jonathan Wainwright](https://twitter.com/jon_macsim) talked aboutÂ **Localisation** (or l10n for those already familiar). Like all good talks, there was a great discussion afterwards.

After a short breakÂ [Andrew Donaldson](https://twitter.com/adonaldson)Â led a discussion on how we can evolve our meetings. This was intended to just be a call for more <del>organisers</del> stewards (which still stands â€“ if you're interested let us know), but expanded into a round table discussion on what people want Code Cumbria to **be**. This is too expansive a topic to summarise, so you can read [detailed notes here](/2017/02/evolving-our-meetings/).

FollowingÂ that discussion we decided on a theme for our next meeting:

**Making our own games**

As well as an open call for talks on this theme, we will try out mob programming/blind learning: we'll split into some groups (one laptop each) and try out a game development environment (e.g., <a href="https://www.scirra.com/construct2" target="_blank">Construct 2 (Free Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker" target="_blank">GameMaker Studio Free</a>, or <a href="https://unity3d.com" target="_blank">Unity (Personal)</a>) from installation through to (hopefully) a working game!

Our next meeting is on **February 22<sup>nd</sup> 2017** â€“ we'll post more details soon â€“Â and we look forward to seeing you there!

In between meetings you will always [find us on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/codecumbria/shared_invite/enQtNjM4MTQ3MzI1OTc1LWY1ODc2MGY3ZjQwOTY0OTViM2Y5NjE4MWIyMmVhNTI3MjQzYWYxZjBmNGQ5ZTQ2NTdjODViM2M5NGI4OWJmNzA).
