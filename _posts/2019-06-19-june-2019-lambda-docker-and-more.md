Our next event will be held on Wednesday June 26th, again hosted by [The Guild](https://www.theguild-carlisle.co.uk/) at their amazing co-working space.

We have a few talks lined up:

- "A gentle introduction to [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/): A performant if suboptimal example" by [Andew Donaldson](https://twitter.com/adonaldson)
- "Introduction to [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)" by [David Murphy](https://twitter.com/schwuk)
- Project Showcase: a demonstration of projects our members have been working on. This will be kicked off by [Matthew Proudman](https://twitter.com/Matthewproudman), but other attendees are welcome to show off their work too

No need for tickets this time. Doors will be open from 17:30.
