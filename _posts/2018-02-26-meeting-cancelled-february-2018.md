Due to lack of appropriate venue, we have decided to cancel the meeting for this Wednesday – February 28th 2018.

Apologies for the short notice.

We hope to be back in March, and will keep you informed. In the meantime if any Code Cumbrians want to self-organise and have their own meet, no matter how small, let us know and we will promote it for you.
