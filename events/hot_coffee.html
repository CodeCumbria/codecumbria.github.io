    <p class="lead">The next {{ page.title }} will take place at <strong><a href="http://www.thecoffeekitchen.co.uk/">The Coffee Kitchen</a></strong> in Cockermouth on <strong>Tuesday October 15<sup>th</sup>, 2013</strong> beginning at 11:00 and ending at 14:00.</p>
    <p><strong>{{ page.title }}</strong> is a new co-working event in the Code Cumbria calendar, and aims to help those of us that work from home break the cycle of not leaving the house for days at a time or working in our pyjamas!</p>
    <p>There's no pattern yet to the events, but the intention is to meet in a different coffee shop (in a different town) at least once a month. We're starting in Cockermouth, but will be including Carlisle, Penrith, Keswick, Workington and Whitehaven in the rotation.</p>
    <p>The emphasis is on getting work done, and not just socialising - we just happen to be working in a different place (with people!).</p>
    <p>No ticket/RSVP is required - just turn up!</p>
