Code Cumbria
============

[Code Cumbria](https://codecumbria.org) is an inclusive group for anyone
involved or interested in technology, software development, and digital
creativity in Cumbria, North-West England and South-West Scotland.

This is the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-powered site, based on [Hydeout](https://fongandrew.github.io/hydeout/) for Code Cumbria.

The website is hosted using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).

Setting up development environment
----------------------------------

All the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)/[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) requirements can be used through [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you system has:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- A text editor

Modifying the content

Edit/add files as necessary. Since we're leveraging the power of Github pages and Jekyll, don't forget you can edit files directly through Github for instant satisfaction.
